"""Shared fixtures for the vantadb_py test suite (MOD-16).

Two things happen here:

1. Every ``Client`` opened during a test is tracked and closed at teardown
   (MOD-16 contract). PyO3 instances are neither gc-visible nor weakref-able,
   so tracking hooks the package attribute (conftest imports before any test
    module; both ``import vantadb_py as vanta`` and ``from vantadb_py import
    Client`` styles resolve it, including ``AsyncClient``'s inner sync
   handle). Reopening a file-backed path closes the previous tracked handle
   first (Fjall takes an exclusive lock per path), mirroring the
   refcount-release timing helpers like ``migrate_from_*`` rely on mid-test.

2. Explicit ``memory_limit_bytes`` values are floored to
   ``_MIN_TEST_MEMORY_LIMIT``. The engine's backpressure guard compares
   PROCESS-WIDE RSS against this limit (FND-01-F1:
   ``src/storage/engine/stats.rs::check_memory_pressure`` reads process RSS,
   not per-engine bytes), so a "small" 128 MiB budget is really a
   whole-process budget. Once heavy optional test deps (chromadb/lancedb add
   ~110 MiB) push the interpreter baseline past 128 MiB x 0.80 default
   threshold, every write rejects with ``ResourceLimit`` and cascades into
   dozens of failures across files, even though each DB holds only a few
   records. The floor restores the tests' evident intent ("a small DB with
   plenty of headroom") under the engine's actual semantics.
