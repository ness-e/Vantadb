"""MOD-17: concurrent close() must not deadlock the interpreter.

Root cause (pre-fix): ``Client.close()`` called ``OpGate::drain()`` while
holding the GIL. The drain waits on a condvar until the in-flight op count
reaches zero, but every in-flight op returning from its own ``py.detach``
must re-acquire the GIL before it can drop its ``OpGuard`` — so the count
never reaches zero and both threads block forever.

Fix: drain runs inside ``py.detach`` (PyO3 0.29 parallelism guide: always
detach when blocked work needs the GIL back).
