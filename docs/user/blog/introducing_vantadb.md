# Introducing VantaDB

*By the VantaDB Team*

Every vector database I've used in the last two years has the same shape: a server. You spin up a container, connect over the network, serialize your embeddings, send them across, and wait. The wait is never long in absolute terms — 20ms, 50ms, 150ms — but it is always there, always a hop, always a billable event.

## The local-first thesis

VantaDB starts from a different premise: the fastest network hop is no network hop. If your application needs hybrid retrieval — BM25 for keywords, HNSW for vectors, RRF to fuse them — that retrieval should happen inside the process that already has the embeddings. No serialization. No connection pool. No API key. No per-query cost.

This is not a rejection of cloud databases. Pinecone and Weaviate are excellent products for teams that need managed scale, multi-region replication, and someone else to carry the pager. VantaDB is for the other cases: agents that need durable memory, RAG pipelines that can't leak data, edge devices with no cloud access, and developers who want to ship without a credit card on file.

## Why Rust, why PyO3

We chose Rust for the core because memory safety is not optional in a database, and because deterministic performance is not optional in a retrieval engine. There is no garbage collector pause to explain away in a p99 latency chart. The PyO3 bindings expose a stable `src/sdk.rs` boundary — Python callers never touch raw pointers, and the FFI surface is narrow enough to audit by hand.

The result is an engine that runs in-process, serves hybrid queries in 1.2ms, recovers from crashes via a CRC32C-checksummed WAL, and costs nothing to operate beyond the hardware you already own. It is Apache 2.0, it is on PyPI, and it is ready for you to try today.

```bash
pip install vantadb-py
```
