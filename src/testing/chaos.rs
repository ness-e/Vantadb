// ponytail: chaos harness expects intentional panics; documented per-call.
#![allow(clippy::expect_used, clippy::unwrap_used)]

//! Reusable harness for failpoint-based chaos testing.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```rust
//! use vantadb::testing::chaos::ChaosTestHarness;
//!
//! let mut chaos = ChaosTestHarness::new().unwrap();
//!
//! // Enable a failpoint — operations that hit it return errors
//! chaos.enable("wal_append_fail", "return");
//! let result = chaos.engine.insert(&vantadb::node::UnifiedNode::new(1));
//! assert!(result.is_err());
//!
//! // Remove all failpoints and verify recovery
//! chaos.disable_all();
//! chaos.assert_recovery();
//!
//! // Clean up
//! chaos.destroy();
//! ```
