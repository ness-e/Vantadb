//! HTTP server split by concern (REVIEW-10).
//!
//! Prior to this module, the entire HTTP server — routing, RBAC, TLS, OTEL,
//! bootstrap and inline tests — lived in a single `src/cli_server.rs` file of
//! 5300+ lines. The split moves:
//!
//! - Shared types and DTOs into [`state`].
//! - Error builders into [`errors`].
//! - Middleware (auth, rate-limiting, circuit breaker, metrics) into [`middleware`].
//! - OTEL/tracing setup into [`telemetry`].
//! - Bootstrap (run, shutdown, auth validation, TLS) into [`bootstrap`].
//! - Handlers (health, CRUD, search, graph, maintenance, threads, conversation, skills, snapshots) into [`handlers`].
//! - Router topology (app, CORS, dashboard) into [`router`].
//! - Legacy facade [`routing`] for backward compatibility (re-exports).
//!
//! The public surface under `crate::cli_server` is unchanged: all symbols
//! are re-exported here so existing callers (e.g. `vantadb-server`,
//! `tests/request_id.rs`) keep working without edits.
