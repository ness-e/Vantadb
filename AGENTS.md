# VantaDB

**Single source of truth:** `.opencode/AGENTS.md` — all agent instructions live there (project rules, AI Guardian, CodeGraph, MCP servers, path resolution, release workflow).

This file exists only for compatibility with agents that look for `AGENTS.md` at the repo root (Claude Code, etc.). **Do not duplicate content here** — edit `.opencode/AGENTS.md`.

> **Note (C-01):** `.opencode/` is local-only tooling (untracked from git, stays on disk). A fresh clone won't have it; the repo builds and tests without it.
