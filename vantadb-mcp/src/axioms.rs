//! VantaDB has no axiom-write API in core (MCP-33): `src/agentic/` has no
//! axioms module. Agent-managed axioms are therefore stored as records in the
//! reserved `_axioms` namespace — one record per axiom, `key` = axiom name,
//! `payload` = JSON `{"id", "name", "description"}`. The Iron Axioms are
//! hardcoded below, are never written, and are always merged into the result.
